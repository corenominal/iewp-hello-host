# Hello Host WordPress Plugin

![WordPress Tested](https://img.shields.io/badge/wordpress-4.5.3%20tested-brightgreen.svg)

This is a hack of Matt Mullenweg's famous [Hello Dolly plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/). Instead of a lyric from Louis Armstrong's "Hello, Dolly", when activated you will see your server's hostname in the upper right of your admin screen on every page. It is intended to be a handy plugin for developers who work with 'development' and 'production' servers.
